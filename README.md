I started my vim + tmux journey thanks to the [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r6yzFEXajQ) of [@nicknisi](https://github.com/nicknisi/). As such, most of the configurations you found here is shamelessly stolen from his [dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles). Big props to him!
